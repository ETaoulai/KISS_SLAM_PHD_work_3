    which is KISS-ICP's own run-to-run noise (two identical runs differ by 1.1e-14 m,
    from multithreaded reductions in the C++ registration).

    The residual needs a nearest-neighbour index over the whole local map; the KISS
    voxel map exposes no NN query to Python, so a scipy KDTree is built.

    Measured on `indoor_fast`, 400 frames (ms/frame, and bias of the mean RMS):

    Caching the tree is a poor trade: it buys less speed than switching the residual
    off, and inflates it because the reused map lacks the most recent frames.  To go
    fast, set `icp_metrics: false`; the other diagnostics (motion, model deviation,
    adaptive sigma, geometry) stay on because they are cheap.  Keep `rebuild_every=1`
    whenever the absolute RMS value matters, and never compare RMS across runs made
    with different settings.
